This project is really fun, and taught me the basics of web development -- and I mean, the extreme rudimentary basics.
All that is needed to run this is some sort of web server (I use Apache), and PHP. 

I am using docker-compose to manage this now, where before I was using a complete LAMP stack. Docker accomplishes my goals much, much easier, and much more effectiently.
