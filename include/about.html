           <p class="w3-text-grey">After graduating from Richland High School with Honors, I decided to go straight to college. I was doing great, until I figured out that I had no idea what I wanted out of school. I took some time off, 
            became a roofer, of which I am very successful at being, and am now 100% sure in my future - I will go back to school, get a Software Engineering degree, and achieve greatness. As a roofer, I install the highest quality metal roofs in
            the DFW Metroplex. As a student, I absorb knowledge like none other. And as a Software Developer, I continue to learn new strategies to create and deploy fun and interesting applications. As your best friend -- well, you should 
            already know, friend!
