					<h5>Programming Since 2013</h5>
					<p class="w3-text-grey">
						When I was just 13 years old, I discovered the joy of programming. I began my software development journey with LUA, in a video game called Garry's Mod. I created a custom server in Garry's Mod 
						that rose to moderate popularity, and lead a community of awesome individuals. I later took as many programming classes as I could in High School, and learned the fundamentals of Java and C#. I am currently working towards
						a Bachelor of Science in Software Engineering, and am attending Tarrant County College with plans to transfer to UTA in Fall 2023.
